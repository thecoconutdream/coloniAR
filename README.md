This project is implemented by students from the University of Cologne in cooperation with the 
Digital Humanities.  
While Autodesk's *3ds Max* and the open-source 3D computer graphics software *Blender* developed by the Blender Foundation was used for modelling; texturing, programming and implementation was done in *Unity* (version 2019.1.0f2).
Additionally Google's ARCore SDK (version 1.9.0) was utilized. 

## What is the project about?

This project's main goal was the development of an augmented reality application, which is targeted towards children and families. Thematically it is set in the former Roman colony of Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (CCAA),
which was located in the modern day city of Cologne, Germany. It attempts to reconstruct famous Roman remains, that are spread throughout the city, providing the user with information in a playful way. 
The information is relayed through an implemented dialogue system and venture points implemented within each individual scene. The information is narrated by the fictional character Claudia (voiced by *Fine*), a Roman girl,
who used to live in the former Roman colony of CCAA. The app encourages exploration of the environment, as finding information unlocks 
new rooms to explore. Thus the project leans on the concept of gamification as it provides users with rewards for their various achievements and features several endings based on the user's performance.

3D models were created using information provided by previous attempts of the sites' reconstructions and information provided by the Romano-Germanic Museum, which is located in Cologne, Germany.
Visually the app implements a comicbook aestehtic as it uses cel-shaded graphics, which aims at making it more appealing towards the younger demographics. This is also evident in the graphics used in the app's title and home screens
as well as the simple menu navigation.
